# March 19, 2017 Sprint Retrospective

This blog post was originally published on March 23, 2017.

This past Sunday’s code sprint was a huge success!

We had 15 developers spend a whole day at work on [Billy-to-Pupa conversion](http://docs.openstates.org/en/latest/contributing/pupa-conversion.html). With [13 new PRs](https://github.com/openstates/openstates/pulls) from that group alone, we’re well on our way to the next step in [our 2017 roadmap](https://github.com/openstates/meta/wiki/2017-Roadmap#pupa-ization).

A huge thank-you from James and myself to everyone who dedicated their day off to the project: @jmcarp, @hmoco, @erinspace, @lmm54321, @rshorey, @lindsayyoung, @showerst, @mroswell, @lmdragun, @gregjd, @jschiarizzi, @jalbertbowden, and @amitnagis. And an additional thanks to [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) for hosting us, and providing breakfast and refreshments.

For everyone who’s not in the Washington, DC area, stay tuned: we’re planning a virtual code sprint for a weekend day in April! Details to come soon on this blog or follow [@openstates](http://twitter.com/openstates).
