title: Open States & Google Summer of Code 2018
---

We’re excited to announce that Open States has been accepted as a participating organization in [Google Summer of Code 2018](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)!

Last year we had [Hitesh Garg](https://blog.openstates.org/@hiteshgarg14) help us break ground on a brand new data admin tool. We’re excited to have the opportunity to work with a couple of new students this year and see what great improvements we can build together this summer.

For those unfamiliar, GSoC is an opportunity for students to work on selected Open Source projects. Our selection means we’ll have at one student working on the project with us this summer and paid a stipend by Google. If you know a qualified student that you think would be interested please send them our way!

## Next Steps

The next month is time for us to connect with interested students. Interested students should:

* join our [Slack](https://openstates-slack.herokuapp.com/) (be sure to introduce yourself in #gsoc2018)

* check out our [ideas page](https://github.com/openstates/meta/wiki/GSoC-2018-Overview) and start planning what they’d like to work on if selected

* start getting familiar with our [active projects](https://github.com/openstates), maybe [submit a patch or two](https://github.com/openstates/openstates/issues)

The student application period is from March 12th-27th, and selections will be made in April & work starts in May.

## Tips for Students

We’re really glad you’re considering working with us! If you’re looking to work with us it is important we see you interacting with the community: introduce yourself, write a patch, tell us what you’re interested in and what you’d like to work on.

And if you’re going to be near DC let us know & maybe we can meet up!

GSoC is a great opportunity for you and for the project. We want to make sure we engage with students that are going to be a part of the team, so getting involved is essential to show us you’re going to be a dedicated team member throughout the summer and beyond. In the past GSoC participants have become core contributors to the project & we’d love to see that happen again!
