We’re excited to announce our second code sprint of 2017. And this time, we’re running it virtually, so that community members outside of DC can join in!

So, hop on the [Open States Slack](https://openstates-slack.herokuapp.com/), set aside Sunday, April 23 on your calendars, and get ready.

James, myself, and other core developers will be online from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM Eastern Time (14:00 to 22:00 UTC). During that time, we’ll be ready to enable any and all contributions to the project, including:

- onboarding anyone who’s new to Open States, helping them if they run into any issues with our [quick-start documentation](http://docs.openstates.org/en/latest/contributing/getting-started.html), and pointing them in the [right direction](https://github.com/openstates/openstates/issues) from there
- working with existing members of the Open States community to continue scraper [conversion](https://github.com/openstates/meta/wiki/2017-Roadmap#pupa-ization) to the Open Civic Data framework; we’ve made [good progress](https://github.com/openstates/openstates/issues/1442) so far, and are excited to close out more states
- discussing infrastructure choices, feature requests, website redesgning, and other items on [our 2017 roadmap](https://github.com/openstates/meta/wiki/2017-Roadmap)

Looking forward to seeing y’all! And as always, stay in touch and stay tuned on the Open States [Slack](https://openstates-slack.herokuapp.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/openstates/openstates), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openstates).
