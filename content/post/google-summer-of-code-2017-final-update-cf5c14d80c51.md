title: Google Summer of Code 2017 Final Update
---

Hello everyone!

I’m finally wrapping up my [Google Summer of Code project](https://blog.openstates.org/google-summer-of-code-data-quality-tools-update-bb8d9d1edabf?source=collection_home---5------0----------------). It was a very successful journey, and I’m extremely happy that I got to work with an organization like Open States. I would like to thank my mentors Miles and James for providing me guidance to successfully complete the project. Here’s a summary of what I produced:

## **Overview**

The purpose of this project was to build Open Civic Data administrative data tools, and additionally to help with the pupa-ization of existing scrapers. These admin tools will identify data quality issues in our database, and allow Open States administrators to manually fix or modify them. [Here is my final report for Google regarding the project and its success](https://gist.github.com/hiteshgarg14/7a8bc91dbe700edc10f91d173bbc1bc4).

All of the code is available in the [openstates/admintools](https://github.com/openstates/admintools) repository.

## Learning and Challenges

While I was working on the project I learned lot of things that have improved my overall coding abilities and quality as a programmer. Most importantly, I learned the importance of continuous integration and unit testing. GSoC has really helped me to grow as a developer!

## Summary

I have been involved with Open States for nearly six months now. And with GSoC, I have been enabled to more greatly contribute to the open source world. My time with Open States has been amazing. I am grateful to Google for organizing this, and Open States for giving me this valuable learning opportunity.
