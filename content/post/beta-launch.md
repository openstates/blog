A view of the Open States beta site on the District of Columbia page.

If you don’t read the Sunlight Labs blog as religiously as I do (you should!), you might miss that our Open States project now has a public beta site up and running. Users can find who their state reps are, their voting record and contact information, the most recent actions taken by the legislature and search the full text of current and past bills. The OpenStates.org site is now the best place to find information on the activities in these 20 state legislatures: Alaska, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin with more coming soon.

For more information on the new site read my colleague James Turk’s post here. Also be sure to play with the iOS app or, if you’re a developer, use the API and join the Google Group. Our Scout project incorporates the Open States API to allow users to follow and search bills in all 50 states.

Please check out the beta site and let us know what you think. We are constantly adding features and are rapidly expanding the site to include remaining states. Thank you to the Rita Allen Foundation for their continued support of this project.
