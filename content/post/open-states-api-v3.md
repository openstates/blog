## API v3 is here!

Back in September, I [announced the beta of Open States API v3](https://blog.openstates.org/open-states-api-v3-beta/) and as of today it is moving from beta status to fully supported.  Since the initial release there have been quite a few updates, all noted in the [changelog](https://docs.openstates.org/en/latest/api/v3/changelog.html).

While API v3 will continue to improve, it has been moved to production servers, backwards-incompatible changes will be kept to a minimum and announced well in advance, and rate limits are a bit higher than they were during the beta accordingly.

For more details on API v3:

* [Interactive Docs](https://v3.openstates.org/docs)

## API v1 is going away!

As mentioned previously, this milestone will also mark the formal deprecation date of API v1.
From this point on API v1 access will be limited to keys that already use it, and throttled to encourage users to upgrade.  If you're still using API v1 and haven't gotten in touch, [please do so](mailto:contact@openstates.org).

The plan is to fully remove the endpoints after the bulk of 2021 sessions have ended, or usage has decreased to the point that it seems reasonable to stop maintaining them.

## 2021 Session Updates

It's that time of the year, elections are done and states are beginning to prepare for upcoming sessions.  We have a plan in place and will be aiming to update state information as quickly as possible throughout December and January as states come back online.

If you're curious about the status of a particular state or up for helping out we have two tracking issues you can check out [the document where we're tracking all of this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMHwaMXH_eFd-DP62PC0OehLaYgrXjYC6lbq-ocSW_Q/edit#gid=0), and request access if you are hoping to help.

Thanks for reading and stay tuned here and/or follow [@openstates](https://twitter.com/openstates) on twitter, as we have a bit more exciting news coming before the end of the year!
