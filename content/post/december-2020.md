In 2020 we put out our [most ambitious roadmap](https://blog.openstates.org/2020-roadmap/) in a long time.  It included launching [bill tracking](https://blog.openstates.org/tracking-legislation-on-open-states/), bulk data, and API improvements.  Thanks to the [funding](https://blog.openstates.org/openstates-nsf-funding/) we received, we launched all of the major features we had planned, and then some.  We also wound up putting out some surprises we hadn’t planned on, like our [COVID-19 legislation tracking](https://openstates.org/covid19/), new [municipal data](https://blog.openstates.org/august-2020-update/), and our new shiny [API v3](https://blog.openstates.org/open-states-api-v3/), which is already seeing great adoption!  We’re really proud of what we were able to accomplish with the support of our community and excited to share our preliminary 2021 plans.

# 2021: Data, Data, Data

As is somewhat typical for odd-numbered years, the focus for 2021 will largely be on data quality improvements.  As many of you know, we typically spend the first part of an odd-numbered year working on session data as most states enter new sessions with new legislative rosters.  We expect Q1 of 2021 to largely be focused on these session updates, including a full refresh of our people data to cover gaps in contact information and biographical data.

Given the data-focused nature of our 2021 plans, most of our planned tasks are longer-term improvements that will have wide-ranging impact across Open States.  2021 priorities will include:

* Drastically improved timeliness of data: we’ll be scraping states multiple times a day, aiming to reduce the time between legislative updates and the data appearing in the Open States API.
* People data refresh: we’ll be working on new processes to keep this data fresh, including changes to contact information and other infrequently updated fields.
* More data quality dashboard work: ways for developers and power users to determine what data might be missing from upstream so we can continue to improve our scrapers.

There’ll of course also be quite a few additional improvements to our APIs, and we’ll have more to say on OpenStates.org features later in the year.

### Stay Tuned!! 

We also have some very exciting news coming in the next month or so: after four years of being run as an independent project, typically with volunteer time and very limited resources, Open States has found a new home.  I’m very eager to share the details, and we will as soon as a few key pieces are finalized.  For now, rest assured that not much will change for most users, except you can expect our data quality and timeliness to become a much bigger priority.

Happy New Year, we’ll see you in the 2021 sessions!
